# Prognosis_Ai_Project
Prognosis AI is an innovative web application designed for predicting three major health conditions: Heart Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Diabetes. Leveraging the power of machine learning, this project empowers users to assess their risk of these diseases by inputting relevant medical parameters.
# Key Features:
**Diabetes Prediction:** Leveraging Logistic Regression, Prognosis AI predicts the risk of diabetes by analyzing relevant health metrics.

**Parkinson's Disease Prediction:** Employing a Support Vector Machine Classifier, this component assesses the probability of Parkinson's Disease, providing early insights for better disease management.

**Heart Disease Prediction:** Utilizing a Random Forest Classifier, Prognosis AI  predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on a set of critical medical attributes.
